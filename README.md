# Career Node

A project by Team funtimeError for the Yantra Hackathon

#### About the project:

The project was made for the hackathon's `Track #2: QUALITY EDUCATION`

###### Problem Statement:

```
The challenge at hand is to devise cutting-edge technological solutions leveraging data analytics, AI, personalized algorithms, real-time industry monitoring, networking platforms, skill assessment tools, and online learning resources to empower individuals in education and career transitions. These solutions should provide personalized career guidance, facilitate skill development, and bridge the gap between education and industry requirements.
```

###### Our Solution:

```
We have solved this problem by creating a web application that implements our recommendation framework with an emphasis on a clean, simple and hassle-free UI and UX.

Our recommendation framework takes your resume and processes it. We then display to you 3 to 5 broad domains, of which you can choose one. You will then be provided with a few sub-domains, and upon choosing one of your liking, you will be shown a few job roles. You can highlight whichever role that you prefer and information regarding that role, as well as training resources for that role shall be displayed.
