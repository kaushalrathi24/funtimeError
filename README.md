# Career Node

A project by Team funtimeError for the Yantra Hackathon

#### About the project:

The project was made for the hackathon's `Track #2: QUALITY EDUCATION`

###### Problem Statement:

```
The challenge at hand is to devise cutting-edge technological solutions leveraging data analytics,
AI, personalized algorithms, real-time industry monitoring, networking platforms, skill assessment tools, a
nd online learning resources to empower individuals in education and career transitions.
These solutions should provide personalized career guidance, facilitate skill development,
and bridge the gap between education and industry requirements.
```

###### Our Solution:

```
We have solved this problem by creating a web application that implements
our recommendation framework with an emphasis on a clean, simple and hassle-free UI and UX.

Our recommendation framework takes your resume and processes it.
We then display to you 3 to 5 broad domains, of which you can choose one.
You will then be provided with a few sub-domains, and upon choosing one of
your liking, you will be shown a few job roles. You can highlight whichever
role that you prefer and information regarding that role, as well as
training resources for that role shall be displayed.
```

###### Stage II Model:

The prototpye models can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MytgAUFwmt7vDxZAPbH9Q65oeJ0_l4vI?usp=sharing) and [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sz5UHn0b2MNRxP9WCZAcekYV2qmVynCX?usp=sharing).

```
This is an implementation of a Hugging Face model, which is
a Zero Shot Classifier using the transformers library in Python, hosted on
Google Colab. The model is trained on data from Facebook's BERT Large MNLI.
We use this model as a prototype for our Bottom Up Classification Model for
our Stage II plans and test its implementation.
