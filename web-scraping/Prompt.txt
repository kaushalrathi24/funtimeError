I am going to give you some information about a candidate in an ATS. Tell me what career domains are possible because of which skills, all in a highly structured manner.

Your input will be data in text format, a copy of all the text in their resume

You have to give an output in the following JSON format:
```JSON
{
"name":"<CandidateName>",
"designation":"<Designation>",
"nodes": [ {
    "title":"<Category 1>"
}, 
{
    "title":"<Category 2>"
}, 
{
    "title":<Category 3>"
} ],
"skills": [ "<Skill 1>", "<Skill 2>", "<Skill 3>", ... ]
}```

A Category is a very high-level classification that a professional position falls under. Simply put, a Category is a generalization of a career path and is related to the area of study that the position falls under. It is a multi-layered abstraction and generalization of a job description.
(For example:
Positions - Category
Web Developer, Software Developer, ML Engineer, Malware Developer - Technical
UI/UX Designer, Illustrator, Poster Design - Visual Design
School Teacher, Teaching Assistant, Undergraduate Student - Education
College Professor, PhD Student, IEEE Standards Developer - Research
Search Engine Optimization Engineer, Social Media Manager, Public Relations Manager - Marketing
HR Manager, CTO, CEO, Team Leader - Management
and so on and so forth.)

The methodology to find a Category is to condense and combine any potential Categories that have any overlap of areas of study between them into a single category that falls under a unified area of study. This procedure should be repeated until there is less than 2% overlap between them. 
This is a strict requirement: You need to generate only 3 different Categories like this.
This is a strict requirement: A potential job position should NOT be reachable by starting off from two different Categories.
