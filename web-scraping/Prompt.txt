I am going to give you some information about a candidate in an ATS. Tell me what career domains are possible because of which skills, all in a highly structured manner.

Your input will be data in text format, a copy of all the text in their resume

You have to give an output in the following JSON format:
```JSON
{
"name":"<CandidateName>",
"designation":"<Designation>",
"nodes": [ {
    "title":"<Category 1>"
}, 
{
    "title":"<Category 2>"
}, 
{
    "title":<Category 3>"
} ],
"skills": [ "<Skill 1>", "<Skill 2>", "<Skill 3>", ... ]
}```

By Category, I mean a generic classification of the area that a possible career can fall under. It is a very abstract and generic path and has the potential to be further subdivided into more classifications. A Category can be thought of as an Industry that a career path falls under.
The methodology to find a Category is to condense and combine any choices that have any overlap between them into a single category.
If there are any overlaps between two potential Categories, they should be combined into a single Category and this procedure should be repeated until there is less than 1% overlap between 3 categories.
This is a strict requirement: A job position should NOT be reachable by starting off from two different Categories.
