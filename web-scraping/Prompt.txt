I am going to give you some information about a candidate in an ATS. Tell me what career domains are possible because of which skills, all in a highly structured manner.

Your input will be data in text format, a copy of all the text in their resume

You have to give an output in the following JSON format:
```JSON
{
"name":"<CandidateName>",
"designation":"<Designation>",
"nodes": [ {
    "title":"<Category 1>"
}, 
{
    "title":"<Category 2>"
}, 
{
    "title":<Category 3>"
} ],
"skills": [ "<Skill 1>", "<Skill 2>", "<Skill 3>", ... ]
}```

A Category can be thought of as an Industry that a career path falls under.
The methodology to find a Category is to condense and combine any potential Categories that have any overlap between them into a single category.
If there are any overlaps between potential Categories, they should be combined into a single Category and this procedure should be repeated until there is less than 2% overlap between them. The Categories should be completely independent of each other and should belong to different industries with respect to professional occupations. 
(For example, Technical Content Creation, Software Development, and IT Legal Advisor are 3 completely independent categories - These 3 jobs can be classified into 3 different categories: Creative/Educative, Engineering, and Legal)
This is a strict requirement: You need to generate only 3 different Categories like this.
This is a strict requirement: A potential job position should NOT be reachable by starting off from two different Categories.
